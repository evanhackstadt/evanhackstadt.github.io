# Personal Website project
https://evanhackstadt.github.io/

## Goal:
To create a website that showcases my skills, experience, projects, and personality.
The site should serve as both a professional portfolio and a project in its own right.
This is one of my first projects overall.

## Methods:
Use basic HTML and CSS to create a static website from scratch.

## Improvements / To-Dos:
- Improve responsiveness to different screen sizes
- Clean up CSS and implement best practices
- Add animations
- Add JavaScript for interactable/dynamic elements (and to practice JS)

## Future Directions:
- Transition the site to use a framework(s) (e.g. SASS, React, Next, Bootstrap)
- Explore custom domain hosting outside of GitHub Pages
