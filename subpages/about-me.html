                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p class="spacing-1-5">From a young age, I've always been interested in <strong>technology</strong>, organization, and creating systems.</p>
                <p class="spacing-1-5">High school broadened my horizons — I found joy in nearly all subjects,
                    developed <strong>diverse interests and hobbies</strong>, and started forming my ethics values.</p>
                <p class="spacing-1-5">Read on about some of my interests and values below.</p>

                <h3>Health & Fitness</h3>
                <p>I'm passionate about science-based health and fitness.</p>
                <p class="spacing-1-5">I was never into sports until I started running and joined cross-country / track my senior year of high school.</p>
                <p class=spacing-1-5">Since then I've gotten into resistance training and I'm currently exploring cycling and swimming.</p>

                <h3>Travel & Urbanism</h3>
                <p class="spacing-1-5">I've had the privilege to travel to many places with my family. I love taking trips and exploring new cities.</p>
                <p class="spacing-1-5">Travel cultivated my interest in urban planning, public transit, and walkable cities.
                    I love all types of trains and metro systems.
                    I also love how urbanism intersects with environmentalism and public health.
                </p>
                <p class="spacing-1-5">While I've had the privilege to travel many places, I've always been grateful to call the Pacific Northwest my home.</p>

                <h3>Music & Creativity</h3>
                <p class="spacing-1-5">
                    Music has been a primary hobby of mine. I grew up playing piano, then drums and bass guitar.
                    I also got into <strong>music production</strong> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WAV.length" target="_blank">see what I've made</a>)</p>
                <p class="spacing-1-5">Currently, I mostly just enjoy listening (house, dance, hip-hop, and more) but hope to return to playing someday.</p>
                <p class="spacing-1-5">Beyond music, I also enjoy other forms of creativity such as video editing, graphic design, and writing.</p>

                <h3>Media</h3>
                <p class="spacing-1-5">I enjoy reading books, playing video games, keeping up with my interests on YouTube, and watching the occassional show or movie.</p>
                <p class="spacing-1-5">Favorite genres: sci-fi, dystopian, fantasy, fiction, social commentary</p>

                <h3>Philosophy & Values</h3>
                <p class="spacing-1-5">I care about my impact on the world. I seek to recognize my circles of privilege and utilize them for good.</p>
                <p class="spacing-1-5">
                    I'm passionate about the environment, social justice, and public health.
                    I try to follow through on my values through my diet, consumerism, and political participation.
                    And I hope to make additional commitments later in life.
                </p>
                <p class="spacing-1-5">Moreover, I hope to one day have a career that improves the health of others.</p>
